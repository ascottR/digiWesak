## About the Project

As children, many of us enjoyed exchanging Vesak greeting cards with friends, a tradition filled with joy and creativity. This app aims to digitize that experience, allowing users to create and share personalized Vesak greeting cards online. It's built using React for the frontend, with Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for styling. Additionally, the app leverages the TinyURL API to shorten links for shared cards, making them easy to share.

- **Customizable Cards**: Personalize your card by entering the recipient's name, writing a message, and selecting a card style.
- **Shareable Links**: Use the TinyURL API to generate shortened links for easy sharing.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
